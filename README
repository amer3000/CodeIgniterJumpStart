Building a a quick startup environment for CodeIginter projects.

It is mostly how I setup majority of CodeIgniter projects. However, it may not be the best setup.

Here is a quick overview:

* CodeIgniter 2.1
* Datamapper ORM 1.8.2
* TankAuth 1.0.9
* JQuery 1.7.1
* CSS framewrok (coming soon)
* .htaccess mod to hide index.php file
* minimalist layout.php view file to quickly start coding
