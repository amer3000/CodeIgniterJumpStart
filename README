A quick startup environment for CodeIginter projects.

It is mostly how I setup majority of CodeIgniter projects. However, it may not be the best setup. You may want to make sure that it fits your needs.

Here is a quick overview:

* CodeIgniter 2.1
* Datamapper ORM 1.8.2
* TankAuth 1.0.9
* XTA2 for 3rd party login
* JQuery 1.7.1
* Gridless CSS3 framewrok http://thatcoolguy.github.com/gridless-boilerplate/
* .htaccess mod to hide index.php file
* minimalist layout.php view file to quickly start coding

You can see what it looks like right out of box here: http://amerkhalid.com/CodeIgniterJumpStart/

To get started:
1. Upload all files to a webserver
2. Create a database
3. Update application/config/database.php with correct settings
4. Run sql scripts under sql folder
5. Update .htaccesss file if your CodeIgniter Installation is not in the root folder
6. Update encrypt key in application/config/config.php file
7. Start working on your application :)
